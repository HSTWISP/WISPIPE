=============== What are the files included in a *_final.tar file?  ==========
Spectra 
-- This is the folder containing all the wavelength calibrated 1D spectra extracted from aXe product: *_SPC.fits
	*.SPC is the aXe-extracted FITS file containing FITS binary table extensions.
	
Stamps 
-- This is the folder containing all the wavelength calibrated 1D spectra extracted from aXe product: *_STP.fits
	*.STP is an aXe-genetared multi-extension FITS file containing stamp images of the BEAMS that were extracted.


DATA/DIRECT_GRISM/fin_F*.cat 
-- The matched catalog arranged in declining magnitude order. The numbering of objects are matched between filters. 
	First column is the 'ParID_RA_DEC' name of the object, e.g. 17_33.418926_12.897039
	Numbering convention: < 1000: matched in both filters
		               1000 ~ 2000: F140 (or F160) only
		               >= 2000 : F110 only
-- Summary of SE parameters**:
	F110: if exptime > 1041s, det_thresh=1.9; if exptime < 1041s, det_thresh=2.3  *
		  -mag_zeropoint 26.83
	F140: -det_thresh 2.0
		  -mag_zeropoint 26.46
	F160: -det_thresh 2.3
		  -mag_zeropoint 25.96
	*1041s chosen for a detection limit of 27.5 mag (3 sigma)
	Other shared parameters: 
	-ANALYSIS_THRESH 2.0 -DEBLEND_NTHRESH 64 -DEBLEND_MINCONT 0.005 -detect_minarea 12 (!!!!! 2*6 !!!!)
	-WEIGHT_TYPE MAP_WEIGHT,MAP_RMS
	-filter Y -filter_name $CONFIG/gauss_2.0_5x5.conv -GAIN 'exptime' -STARNNW_NAME $CONFIG/default.nnw -CHECKIMAGE_TYPE SEGMENTATION
**: Note with the change of pixel scale and pixfrac during drizzle, the 'det_minarea' now needs to be updated to HIGHER values. 
	NEEDS TO BE implemented in the test fields sent out, for 

DATA/DIRECT_GRISM/*.reg 
-- region files generated for the direct and grism images based on the cat_F*.cat. 
	Elliptical regions are given corresponding to the SE parameters of major axis, minor axis, and angles (of image units) 


DATA/DIRECT_GRISM/
	F1*0.fits : direct images directly combined using >iraf.combine
	G102.fits & G141.fits: grism image directly combined using >iraf.combine
	F*_drz.fits : astrodrizzled direct image with pixfrac=0.75, final_scale=0.08
	F*_sci.fits : The first extension of the F*_drz.fits
	F*_wht.fits, & F*_rms.fits: weight map and correlated error corrected rms map generated from the F*_drz.fits.
	G*_drz.fits : astrodrizzled grism image with pixfrac=0.75, final_scale=0.08

SEX/F*W_full.cat
 -- Similar to the SExtractor generated catalog but with 2 more indices: 1.ratio of bad pixels 2. spurious flag. 
 		Spurious flags include:;
	        1. objects close to the edge (flag=9)
    	    2. objects that contains > limitr (%) of weight=0 pixels (flag=99)
        	3. objects that are possibly due to star diffractions or persistence  (flag=999)


 		The following spurious objects are removed from future process:
		  1. objects close to the edge  (10 pixels on top, left, bottom edge; and 20 pixels on the right)
          2. objects that contains > 50% weight=0 pixels   the ratio of n_bad/n_total pixels will be stored in the full catalog. 
          3. objects that are possibly due to star diffractions and/or persistence, usually with high eccentricity (ecc > 0.98)
            for an example field see Fig: seflag-par167.png. Cyan regions mark the ones that are being flagged and rejected.
        Update: A 'clean' catalog will be passed on to the pipeline for aXe but the full catalog is also be provided.
  	  Note:  persistence or spikes that are not caught here will be eventually removed by-eye during the spectra inspection
        
SEX/cat_deblend_flag.cat
 --  This catalog include objects that are blended in one filter but not the other. Both the blended and unblended objects are listed. 
     Note these objects are only flagged, but they are still kept in the catalog.

Plots/*.pdf 
--  A pdf file with all the spectra plotted for easy inspection*. 
	*Empty ones are the files that have strange feature, e.g. noisy spikes that does not allow automatic plotting.


G102_DRIZZLE
G141_DRIZZLE 
--  These two folders contain all the 2D drizzled grism images. 
	File names are '[DRZROOTkeyword]_mef_ID[object number].fts', e.g. aXeWFC3_G102_mef_ID5.fits. 
	They are multi-extension FITS files created in the task axedrizzle.
