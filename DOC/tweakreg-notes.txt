Below are some notes on the tweakreg steps I digged out from the WISPIPE V5 update.  --Sophia

TWEAKREG Steps summary:
1. tweakprep.pro to generate image and catalog lists of *flt.fits, , and generate tweakprep.py

2. use tweakprep.py to align *flt.fits files in each filter, separately

3.1 use astrodrizzle to generate CR-removed *crclean.fits files
3.2 use astrodrizzle to produce high S/N images in each filter
	
4.1 use tweaksex.pro to generate catalogs from *crclean*.fits, and generate tweakreg.py
4.2. run SEX on the drizzled images to get their catalogs

5. use tweakreg.py to 
5.1 align *crclean* files in each filter, separately and update header

5.2. run tweakreg to align the drizzled images from different filters, 
	and to create headerlets containing new WCS information to the F110 drizzled image
> LOOKS NORMAL =), difference between F160_flts are higher than F110_flts
> run one more time to generate the hlet.fits files

5.3. apply the new WCS keyword values in headerlets to the original flt images (both GRISM and DIRECT).
