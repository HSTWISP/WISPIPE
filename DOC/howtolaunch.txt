# How to run the WISP PIPELINE V6.1
# Ivano Baronchelli 26 September 2016
#
#
# Before running everything, check the kind of data you want to
# process. At this moment we are only able to process data with both
# the IR filters and grisms are observed. Uvis data may or may not be
# present.
#
# Also, before starting, set your paths as described in the readme
# file. 
#
# -------------------------------
# BEFORE STARTING 
# -------------------------------
#
# Before beeing able to start, be sure you created a folder structure
# like the following, where you can actually reduce your data:
# $PATH/aXe
# $PATH/data
# The first folder (aXe) correspond to the final destination of the reduced
# data. The second one (data) correspond to the field where the
# original raw data downloaded from MAST are saved. Note that once the
# pipeline has started, the original files in the "data" folder will
# be modified.  So you should save a copy of the data you downloaded
# in case you want to run the pipeline again. One option is to create
# a second folder called:
# $PATH/download
# In the "data" folder, the raw data should be saved in folders named
# like (example for field 356):
# $PATH/data/Par356
#
# See the readme on the github page in order to setup your path
# correctly before starting.
#
# Also, currently tweakreg needs to have interactive = False set as
# your default before running the pipeline.
#
# -------------------------------
# PREPARATION
# -------------------------------
#
# Check input exposures using wispipe_initialcheck.sh
# The single exposures of all the filters will be shown in different
# ds9 windows for different filters/grism.
# Single exposures can be removed creating an
# appropriate folder and moving the contaminated (or showing other
# problems) ones in it.
#
# e.g. source wispipe_initialcheck.sh Par302
#
# -------------------------------
# CASE 1: UVIS DATA ARE NOT PRESENT 
# -------------------------------
#
# All in  a tcsh shell, Eureka environment
# PROGRAM TO USE: wispipe.sh
# IN COMBINATION WITH: multiple_par.sh (if desired; edit as
# appropriate from DOC)
#
# If uvis data are not present, the pipeline can be run as follows:
# 1) cd to the path where the WISPIPE folder is installed
#    > cd $WISPIPE
# 2) run the current version of the pipeline
#    > source wispipe.sh Par# > & LOG/log_Par#_6.1.log
#
# Example:
#    > cd $WISPIPE
#    > source wispipe.sh Par302 > & LOG/log_Par302_6.1.log
#
# The data reduction can be launched without interruptions among one
# field and the next, using the program "multiple_par.sh", saved in
# this same folder. Read in this file for more informations.
# NOTE that the multiple par mode can't be used to preprocess uvis
# data. In this case the preprocess must be run using a bash terminal
# and an astroconda environment.
#
#
# -------------------------------
# CASE 2: UVIS DATA ARE PRESENT 
# -------------------------------
#
# Preprocessing in bash, astroconda  environment,
# Reduction in  a tcsh shell, Eureka environment
# PROGRAM TO USE: ,wispipe_uvis_preprocess.sh, wispipe_uvis.sh
# IN COMBINATION WITH: multiple_uvis_preprocess.sh ,multiple_par.sh
# (if desired, in DOC)
#
# FIRST STEP: preprocess (bash, astroconda)
# To preprocess the uvis data, wispipe_uvis_preprocess.sh can be
# used. This program must be run inside a  bash shell and in an
# astroconda environment. Read the instructions in this program and
# modify it coherently to what is needed before run it on the data.
# Multiple fields can be pre-processed in a row if they
# have the same characteristics (ex: all observations before 2012,
# and both uvis filters present). To pre-process multiple fileds at
# the same time use "multiple_uvis_preprocess.sh" but only after
# having modified wispipe_uvis_preprocess.sh coherently with the
# sets of data that are going to be preprocessed (again:read inside this
# program for more information)
# MR recommends keeping a seperate UVIS log from the rest of the
# pipeline log
#
# Example:
# > cd $WISPIPE
# > source wispipe_uvis_preprocess.sh Par302 >> LOG/LOG_uvis_reductionPar302_6.1.log
#
# MR NOTE: I personally would just run the IDL program
# directly. wispipe_uvis_preprocess.sh just calls a single IDL
# program, and this is a waste and doesn't work well since it has to
# edited every time you run it for a different setup. it is better to
# call the IDL program with different flags. Fix this. 
#
# SECOND STEP: reduction (tcsh, Eureka)
# The reduction can be run as in the case 1 (no uvis data present),
# but using the wispipe_uvis.sh program instad. Again, the
# reduction of multiple fields in a row can be obtained using
# "multiple_par.sh", but ONLY AFTER the uvis data are already
# preprocessed in a bash shell and astroconda environment.
#
#    > source wispipe_uvis.sh Par302 > & LOG/log_Par302_6.1.log
